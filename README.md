# JavaScript Fundamentals 🚀

A beginner-friendly project exploring the basics of JavaScript as part of the ALX Software Engineering front-end curriculum.

## 📁 Project Structure

This repo contains scripts that introduce fundamental concepts such as:
- Variables and constants
- Console output
- Functions and scope
- Loops and conditions
- Working with arguments

Each file corresponds to a specific task from the ALX curriculum, like:

- `0-javascript_is_amazing.js`: First constant and print

- Running Node scripts and debugging using terminal

## 🛠 Technologies
